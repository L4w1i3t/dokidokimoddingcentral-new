With a heavy emphasis from fellow visual novel Katawa Shoujo, be expected to be taken on a huge rollercoaster of events with your favourite Doki! Except Monika - sorry about that.

Features:

- Fully fledged routes spanning over 6 months in-game time for Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki. With the whole mod totalling ~550,000 words, this is the longest DDLC mod to date.

- Multiple endings for each Doki - tread lightly, as your actions have consequences.

- Beautiful new CGs for all 3 Dokis, along with brand new backgrounds, weather effects and phone sprites.

- H scenes for Sayori and Yuri (but don't worry, you can toggle them off if you're not into that stuff) - not just mindless fanservice, either.

- A brand new 40~ track OST from our team's musicians, with heavy influences from Katawa Shoujo, Pokemon, Corpse Party and other well known games.

- A fully fleshed out version of the characters; ever wanted to know what the girls are like in school? Their hopes and dreams for the future? Join them in their highs and console them through their lows.

- Extra goodies to be found within - there's a lot that we've kept as a surprise!","Directors: Sir Swampert, kyoryii

You'll watch her grow and learn, and be the hand to guide her when things are at their most unforgiving. This is a story centred around the many challenges life brings, the desire to rise to the occasion, and the consequences that come with hubris.

Hello everyone. We were approached about sharing our project here by the current owner of the forums, so I figured I’d write up a little post myself. This was a project spearheaded by Dr-Black-Jack whom some of you may know. He was the one who wrote out the script and contacted all the artists involved, and I worked on turning his motion books into a (somewhat) interactive executable.

This is a standalone fangame based on DDLC that was worked on for Valentine’s Day 2018. In keeping true with the original source material, there’s definitely a bit of a horror element, just so you’re all aware. Regardless, I hope you all enjoy it.

This will not be a lighthearted story. A story that can end in multiple ways.It is up to you.

To grasp the happy ending she desire's so.To take the rubber chicken of Fate by it's neck.And to turn the cheeks of Tantalus bright pink with a brutal beatdown with said chicken.

To force his hand. To make him call you 'mother'.

You know your objective. Fate is now in your hands

Set two months after this event, our protagonist returns to the literature club after having drifted away from it to find a larger group of 7, now. He finds all three of the girls (Natsuki, Yuri, and of course, Sayori) in the club cute, and this sways him to join. Now, he must help the club get ready for the upcoming Winter Festival, all while trying to impress the girl of his fancy.This game will expand a lot of the features of DDLC. There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love. It tackles how Sayori might deal with her self-awareness, in light of her depression, and also asks what the club would be like if it were larger.

The story takes place after the good ending of DDLC, with a self-aware Sayori thanking you for all you did (while Monika floats out in limbo after her deletion). Set two months after this event, our protagonist returns to the literature club after having drifted away from it to find a larger group of 7, now. He finds all three of the girls (Natsuki, Yuri, and of course, Sayori) in the club cute, and this sways him to join. Now, he must help the club get ready for the upcoming Winter Festival, all while trying to impress the girl of his fancy. This game will expand a lot of the features of DDLC. There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love. It tackles how Sayori might deal with her self-awareness, in light of her depression, and also asks what the club would be like if it were larger. I won't delve too much further into detail, I'll let that be left for later.","AstraNova, TheFunkMaestro, Nico",No,Yes,No.,No,No,https://dokimods.me/_nuxt/img/thumbnail.960b0a7.jpg,https://www.mediafire.com/file/xedah9z4cxjnkc6/TheNewLC-0.2.0-Mod.zip/file,,No.,,,Yes.,No.

Overview: DDLC Mod: Infinity Gene is a daring meta-adventure visual novel created in Ren'Py that skilfully combines the fast-paced action of a text-based shoot 'em up (SHMUP) with the psychological horror and fourth-wall-breaking tradition of Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC). As a tribute and a rebellious reimagining, this mod was created during a time when DDLC fandom was losing its appeal. It is set in the “Dokiverse,” an interconnected narrative universe based on DDLC’s meta-horror rather than a stand-alone meta-themed universe. Infinity Gene is a thrilling and unnerving journey through a digital battleground where players must face existential questions, rogue AIs, and the very fabric of their game world. It was created for fans of DDLC, visual novels, and experimental storytelling.

Story: Kepler, a self-aware character in Infinity Gene, navigates the Metaverse, a chaotic virtual world ruled by the mysterious Self-Aware Corporation. Kepler fights a never-ending battle against The World, a massive Space Station that represents the Corporation's repressive hold on fandom and creativity, under the direction of the enigmatic Infinity Gene.

June is the blonde girl, but she cannot remember her past, and it hurts her when she tries to remember. Hanako is red-headed, and she is the villain.

And to do so, she needs the Infinity Pens. So, it's up to June to stop her and find the pens before she does.

I just wanted to announce that i'am releasing my first DDLC mod to public.I started playing DDLC back in 2020 but then i didn't know ANYTHING about coding but now i've returned and decided to give this modding thing a try.I decided that i would just do my take on Project Libitina(as for some reason Dan hasn't released it yet) and see how it goes.

Important things to know:

1.I'll be using free assets as i'am not an artist and i just don't know how to make stuff like sprites or backgrounds.

2.This is in DEMO so i'll still be adding a lot of things, i decided to release this to see if people will like it...or not.(pls don't hate).",JakeTheJakeFourth,No,Yes,No,No,No,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MjHZ7dnXaAAFcDTIS5urUse6z3J2HYDI/view?usp=drive_link,https://www.mediafire.com/file/w9dygaskymwuojm/ProjectThirdEye-0.1-Renpy8-DDLCModV3.zip/file,,,,,,
