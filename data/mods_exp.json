At least at the end of the day, everyone seems proud they kept to their vision of what the club should be. Sayori is happy you joined the club, but despite that, you haven't really connected with anyone new. Her puppy eyes are too much to bear, and you reluctantly promise to try and get to know the other members of the club better. Natsuki in particular is puzzling. You can't really put a finger on why she continues to come to club despite seemingly not really getting along with anyone, and that is somewhat intriguing. Maybe you can break the ice with her... Maybe you can be her friend. Maybe something more.",

If you're not into this genre, I would appreciate if you still try it, but I'm not forcing you.\n\nI do apologize for any grammar mistakes you may find while playing the mod. And I don't mind hearing any criticisms since I'll be using them to create a sequel to this mod which is currently in development. Yes there is gonna be a sequel which I have just started making 2 days ago.\n\nAnyway here is the mod",

Before you play, see a doctor.\n\nOverview: DDLC Mod: Infinity Gene is a daring meta-adventure visual novel created in Ren'Py that skilfully combines the fast-paced action of a text-based shoot 'em up (SHMUP) with the psychological horror and fourth-wall-breaking tradition of Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC). As a tribute and a rebellious reimagining, this mod was created during a time when DDLC fandom was losing its appeal. It is set in the “Dokiverse,” an interconnected narrative universe based on DDLC’s meta-horror rather than a stand-alone meta-themed universe. Infinity Gene is a thrilling and unnerving journey through a digital battleground where players must face existential questions, rogue AIs, and the very fabric of their game world. It was created for fans of DDLC, visual novels, and experimental storytelling.\n\nStory: Kepler, a self-aware character in Infinity Gene, navigates the Metaverse, a chaotic virtual world ruled by the mysterious Self-Aware Corporation. Kepler fights a never-ending battle against The World, a massive Space Station that represents the Corporation's repressive hold on fandom and creativity, under the direction of the enigmatic Infinity Gene.",

Reconnecting with Sayori, he meets the Literature Club, where he starts to develop feelings for a certain club president. However, Monika has a secret behind closed doors, and MC has one goal: make Monika happy.\n\nThis demo will contain Act 1: Resonance. This demo is meant to serve as an introduction to the world, as well as provide (hopefully) a good story to keep you immersed. Our team has worked really hard on this, and I'm pretty proud of this myself.",

When they thought that bringing the world back will be the hardest thing to do, they will have to face a new problem: Get everyone in the club to trust Monika again.\nNot to mention a completely new girl who has joined the Literature Club, and she clearly knows more than Monika and the protagonist would have expected.....With a target in common, write the story our beloved Monika deserves.",

Except Monika - sorry about that.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Fully fledged routes spanning over 6 months in-game time for Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki. With the whole mod totalling ~550,000 words, this is the longest DDLC mod to date.\n\n- Multiple endings for each Doki - tread lightly, as your actions have consequences.\n\n- Beautiful new CGs for all 3 Dokis, along with brand new backgrounds, weather effects and phone sprites.\n\n- H scenes for Sayori and Yuri (but don't worry, you can toggle them off if you're not into that stuff) - not just mindless fanservice, either.\n\n- A brand new 40~ track OST from our team's musicians, with heavy influences from Katawa Shoujo, Pokemon, Corpse Party and other well known games.\n\n- A fully fleshed out version of the characters; ever wanted to know what the girls are like in school? Their hopes and dreams for the future? Join them in their highs and console them through their lows.\n\n- Extra goodies to be found within - there's a lot that we've kept as a surprise!",

One life in exchange for two, with the handicap of having limited time and limited attempts. If they succeed, they will have a second life on Earth. If they fail, they will die for good and will never see each other again. On the way they will suffer multiple inconveniences, both fortuitous and intentional, but they will put on the table all the means at their disposal to solve a mystery that surpasses them in all aspects; because they do not understand neither the random reason why they have been entrusted with such a mission, nor the way in which they will be able to achieve such an elusive and apparently impossible purpose.",

As both squirm uncomfortably through the conversation, perhaps MC can close the distance of his new and old relationships, a word at a time.

He was the one who wrote out the script and contacted all the artists involved, and I worked on turning his motion books into a (somewhat) interactive executable.\n\nThis is a standalone fangame based on DDLC that was worked on for Valentine’s Day 2018.

Set two months after this event, our protagonist returns to the literature club after having drifted away from it to find a larger group of 7, now. He finds all three of the girls (Natsuki, Yuri, and of course, Sayori) in the club cute, and this sways him to join. Now, he must help the club get ready for the upcoming Winter Festival, all while trying to impress the girl of his fancy.This game will expand a lot of the features of DDLC. There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love. It tackles how Sayori might deal with her self-awareness, in light of her depression, and also asks what the club would be like if it were larger. I won't delve too much further into detail, I'll let that be left for later.",

Monika restores what she can of the game's broken code, but doesn't have the ability to restore it fully. She instead gives the player a chance to do so, hoping that by making the right choices, everything will return to the way it once was. You'll have many choices, and each choice will impact the story. Each Doki gets their own route with branching dialogue and multiple endings. By the end, you will either have restored the Literature Club to its original state, or let it all fall apart once more.",

      "description": "A grand idea inspired this mod: what about a full-blown sequel to DDLC? The story takes place after the good ending of DDLC, with a self-aware Sayori thanking you for all you did (while Monika floats out in limbo after her deletion). Set two months after this event, our protagonist returns to the literature club after having drifted away from it to find a larger group of 7, now. He finds all three of the girls (Natsuki, Yuri, and of course, Sayori) in the club cute, and this sways him to join. Now, he must help the club get ready for the upcoming Winter Festival, all while trying to impress the girl of his fancy. This game will expand a lot of the features of DDLC. There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love. It tackles how Sayori might deal with her self-awareness, in light of her depression, and also asks what the club would be like if it were larger. I won't delve too much further into detail, I'll let that be left for later.",

It's a more ambitious mod and I've spent a lot more time making this than the original.

Editor's notes: The current version of this mod contains a few bugs that can be ignored by clicking the \"Ignore\" button. Additionally, you can turn on \"Skip unseen text\" on the Settings screen to skip over dialogue while collecting the artworks necessary for the good ending.

After the destruction of DDLC, you must work in a poem to save one of the girls of your preference, and then, when everyone is saved, follow Rookie and the girls in an adventure to help the Resistance free Sonic's world, and rebuild the Doki's universe. The demo follows from the prologue to the first boss battle, with new words for the poem minigame (some of them Sonic related, discover them!), Monika added to the poem minigame and with exclusive scenes, custom sprites (some made by me, some renders of Sonic games), Sonic levels backgrounds, title cards for the ambience, and Sonic Mania/Forces music and sounds added. But watch out! One of the girls will follow an evil route and change radically the story, the menu logos, the poem minigame background and some parts of the dialog. If you choose her and listen to the low pitch Ring sound at the start of her exclusive scenes, you will help her in her Empire dream! (cof cof just Yuri cof cof!) And also, there is a content warning in one of the second exclusive scenes, but there are buttons to choose if you want to skip it, or be brave and see it.",

I mean... that's what DDLC Mods are for, right? Recreate the story that I was trying to tell, but in your own unique way.\"\n\nWith his permission and blessing, Just_Monika.exe: The Rise of the Metal Virus will follow the original story and filling the missing gaps, adding more scary events, but with a twist! Since this mod will be set in the Doki Forces realm, the narrator will be changed to Sonic, which is infected with the new Dr. Eggman's deadliest weapon: the Metal Virus. Is your objective to survive the events Monika will make you suffer in this mod, while keeping the infection at bay in real time, or else Sonic will succumb to the virus and start the Zombots apocalypse in the DDLC world!",

With a main focus on gaslighting, character assassination, forgettable world-building, and testing your patience, you won’t find another mod quite like this. If you’re after a mod that gives love and care to its characters (both literally and metaphorically), then go play The Good Ending. This is an 8-9 hour experience, best suited for readers wanting to suffer as they watch their favorite Dokis grow into manipulated versions of themselves, all while shadowboxing against impossible and non-existent challenges, and plenty of sweet filler to truly cultivate into something insufferable.",

Hanako is red-haired, and she is the villain. Long story short, Monika traps Hanako in a classroom, and June releases her. But Hanako’s true intention is to kill all Monika in existence(another mod). And to do so, she needs the Infinity Pens. So it's up to June to stop here and find the pens before she does. But it looks like Monika is hidden something, too. - CaptainOreo",

He's a typical high school otaku-nerd, who has a wise-guy kinda attitude which makes for the best of banter among his friends. He spends most of his free time reading manga and watching anime. It's at this point we meet Sayori, a sweet, bubbly and overly cheerful girl and also Kenji's childhood friend who just so happens to love eating snacks and has a bottomless pit for a stomach.

Get to know the lives of your favorite Dokis, both in and out of school, and meet new people along the way. Doki Doki Undercurrents, or DDU for short, is a sequel following the events of the original Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC).\n\nIt takes what DDLC has done and builds on its foundations, adding more to the lore and the grim psychological horror. One of the main themes of DDLC was the surreal nature of the unexpected, usually in the form of jumpscares - This mod, however, looks into what truly makes a tale unnerving.\n\nThrough the eyes of Melody, you'll explore the expanded world of Doki Doki Undercurrents, learning about a multitude of characters and their lives, both in and out of school. You'll watch her grow and learn, and be the hand to guide her when things are at their most unforgiving. This is a story centred around the many challenges life brings, the desire to rise to the occasion, and the consequences that come with hubris.\n\nWill you be the one to master the waves, or will you, too, be swept into the undercurrents?",

You'll have hours of gameplay in a story like never before, but you must choose wisely if you don't want to make other's lives a hell on earth.\n\nCancellation Info\n\nSo, it's been dead for like almost three years and I just never got to finish it.
