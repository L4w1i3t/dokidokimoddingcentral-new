At least at the end of the day, everyone seems proud they kept to their vision of what the club should be. Sayori is happy you joined the club, but despite that, you haven't really connected with anyone new. Her puppy eyes are too much to bear, and you reluctantly promise to try and get to know the other members of the club better. Natsuki in particular is puzzling. You can't really put a finger on why she continues to come to club despite seemingly not really getting along with anyone, and that is somewhat intriguing. Maybe you can break the ice with her... Maybe you can be her friend. Maybe something more.",

Thoughts flood his mind, those of anxiety, anticipation― and regret. Another moment. The car passes... Still waiting. It's been years since the boy left his hometown, He wonders if his friends will remember him― he wonders if he still has friends.

This, among other things, applies to the menu, gui, and the music (in this mod there are even more OST's from ES than DDLC OST's), even the saving method (unlike regular DDLC mods, in this mod you first need to point at selected slot, and then again additionally click on the corresponding “Save/Load” button, in general, just like in ES)",

      "description": "Come to shore with this extraordinary fan-made sequel to the critically acclaimed Doki Doki Literature Club! Get to know the lives of your favorite Dokis, both in and out of school, and meet new people along the way. Doki Doki Undercurrents, or DDU for short, is a sequel following the events of the original Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC). It takes what DDLC has done and builds on its foundations, adding more to the lore and the grim psychological horror. One of the main themes of DDLC was the surreal nature of the unexpected, usually in the form of jumpscares - This mod, however, looks into what truly makes a tale unnerving. Through the eyes of Melody, you'll explore the expanded world of Doki Doki Undercurrents, learning about a multitude of characters and their lives, both in and out of school. You'll watch her grow and learn, and be the hand to guide her when things are at their most unforgiving. This is a story centred around the many challenges life brings, the desire to rise to the occasion, and the consequences that come with hubris. Will you be the one to master the waves, or will you, too, be swept into the undercurrents?",
