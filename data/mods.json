At least at the end of the day, everyone seems proud they kept to their vision of what the club should be. Sayori is happy you joined the club, but despite that, you haven't really connected with anyone new. Her puppy eyes are too much to bear, and you reluctantly promise to try and get to know the other members of the club better. Natsuki in particular is puzzling. You can't really put a finger on why she continues to come to club despite seemingly not really getting along with anyone, and that is somewhat intriguing. Maybe you can break the ice with her... Maybe you can be her friend. Maybe something more.",

A story set in a universe much too familiar, a man who was left with nothing but an unrecognized dream, a wanderer who was always in search for answers that he could never find, no matter how hard he looked. A girl behind a wall of books, enveloped in self doubt, wishing to be free from herself. Two paths that you would think would never meet but what if in one, out of infinite realities, their fate intertwined? Watch as how the relationship between the two develops as they try to overcome whatever obstacle that life throws at them and... Will their dreams finally be fulfilled? A slice of life about love, friendship, hardships and unfulfilled dreams.... A story about us.... Koi Ga Kirei (Love is beautiful) What is Koi Ga Kirei? Ko Ga Kirei (KGK for short) is a mod that hopes to give you an experience unlike any other. Putting you in the shoes of a entirely different character, KGK tells a story of a person looking in. Here is a list of what the mod has to offer: A fully custom soundtrack from the Genius mind behind the OSTs of Monika Before Story, and Salvation. Alongside the debut of a rising star who goes by the name Morphonema. Also accompanying the game are almost a Dozen new CGs and custom Backgrounds.

Get to know the lives of your favorite Dokis, both in and out of school, and meet new people along the way. Doki Doki Undercurrents, or DDU for short, is a sequel following the events of the original Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC). It takes what DDLC has done and builds on its foundations, adding more to the lore and the grim psychological horror. One of the main themes of DDLC was the surreal nature of the unexpected, usually in the form of jumpscares - This mod, however, looks into what truly makes a tale unnerving. Through the eyes of Melody, you'll explore the expanded world of Doki Doki Undercurrents, learning about a multitude of characters and their lives, both in and out of school. You'll watch her grow and learn, and be the hand to guide her when things are at their most unforgiving. This is a story centred around the many challenges life brings, the desire to rise to the occasion, and the consequences that come with hubris. Will you be the one to master the waves, or will you, too, be swept into the undercurrents?",
