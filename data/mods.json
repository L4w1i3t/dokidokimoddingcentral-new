Yes there is gonna be a sequel which I have just started making 2 days ago.\n\nAnyway here is the mod",

Before you play, see a doctor.\n\nOverview: DDLC Mod: Infinity Gene is a daring meta-adventure visual novel created in Ren'Py that skilfully combines the fast-paced action of a text-based shoot 'em up (SHMUP) with the psychological horror and fourth-wall-breaking tradition of Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC). As a tribute and a rebellious reimagining, this mod was created during a time when DDLC fandom was losing its appeal. It is set in the “Dokiverse,” an interconnected narrative universe based on DDLC’s meta-horror rather than a stand-alone meta-themed universe. Infinity Gene is a thrilling and unnerving journey through a digital battleground where players must face existential questions, rogue AIs, and the very fabric of their game world. It was created for fans of DDLC, visual novels, and experimental storytelling.\n\nStory: Kepler, a self-aware character in Infinity Gene, navigates the Metaverse, a chaotic virtual world ruled by the mysterious Self-Aware Corporation. Kepler fights a never-ending battle against The World, a massive Space Station that represents the Corporation's repressive hold on fandom and creativity, under the direction of the enigmatic Infinity Gene.",

Except Monika - sorry about that.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Fully fledged routes spanning over 6 months in-game time for Sayori, Yuri and Natsuki. With the whole mod totalling ~550,000 words, this is the longest DDLC mod to date.\n\n- Multiple endings for each Doki - tread lightly, as your actions have consequences.\n\n- Beautiful new CGs for all 3 Dokis, along with brand new backgrounds, weather effects and phone sprites.\n\n- H scenes for Sayori and Yuri (but don't worry, you can toggle them off if you're not into that stuff) - not just mindless fanservice, either.\n\n- A brand new 40~ track OST from our team's musicians, with heavy influences from Katawa Shoujo, Pokemon, Corpse Party and other well known games.\n\n- A fully fleshed out version of the characters; ever wanted to know what the girls are like in school? Their hopes and dreams for the future? Join them in their highs and console them through their lows.\n\n- Extra goodies to be found within - there's a lot that we've kept as a surprise!",

Several hundreds of hours of time and effort have been put into making this mod a high quality experience, and we hope you enjoy the 11+ hours of new content featured.\n\nThis is not a “DDLC Act 1 but with some changes mod”--it’s full, individual routes that start from where Act 1 would usually end in the base game!",

We were approached about sharing our project here by the current owner of the forums, so I figured I’d write up a little post myself. This was a project spearheaded by Dr-Black-Jack whom some of you may know. He was the one who wrote out the script and contacted all the artists involved, and I worked on turning his motion books into a (somewhat) interactive executable.\n\nThis is a standalone fangame based on DDLC that was worked on for Valentine’s Day 2018. In keeping true with the original source material, there’s definitely a bit of a horror element, just so you’re all aware. Regardless, I hope you all enjoy it.\n[/end]",

On rare occasions Sayori comes close to her canon characterization, but these are just brief moments of sanity. With the occasional memes and references to other mods, it could be assumed that this is meant to be comedy.Recommendation: Play in a social setting and watch people's reactions!WARNING: Quitting this mod may require the use of external help (e.g.: Task Manager on Windows)",

Set two months after this event, our protagonist returns to the literature club after having drifted away from it to find a larger group of 7, now. He finds all three of the girls (Natsuki, Yuri, and of course, Sayori) in the club cute, and this sways him to join. Now, he must help the club get ready for the upcoming Winter Festival, all while trying to impress the girl of his fancy.This game will expand a lot of the features of DDLC. There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love. It tackles how Sayori might deal with her self-awareness, in light of her depression, and also asks what the club would be like if it were larger. I won't delve too much further into detail, I'll let that be left for later.",

With a small cast of new characters, and familiar ones, We are the Literature Club sets the stage for an enjoyable \"re-write\" of the world of Doki Doki Literature Club, with a slight twist in an alternate timeline.

Set during a heavily competitive festival revolving around literature (in which the whole town is in on), the Literature Club does everything in their power to collect the most literature out of all the attending clubs. This leads to the club president doing everything she can to win, which sometimes results in her ambition getting the best of her. Caught in the crossfire is our protagonist, who is trying to make the best of the situation. It falls on you to help him make the right choices. Will you be able to help the other club members cope, or focus on more selfish means to resolve the conflicts that arise?",

The story takes place after the good ending of DDLC, with a self-aware Sayori thanking you for all you did (while Monika floats out in limbo after her deletion). Set two months after this event, our protagonist returns to the literature club after having drifted away from it to find a larger group of 7, now. He finds all three of the girls (Natsuki, Yuri, and of course, Sayori) in the club cute, and this sways him to join. Now, he must help the club get ready for the upcoming Winter Festival, all while trying to impress the girl of his fancy. This game will expand a lot of the features of DDLC. There is still poem writing, still drama between the club members, and still all the loveable quirks in the dialogue. However, this game will be much larger. Act 1 has 5 ways to end (though this trickles into only 3 distinct ways to play through Act 2). There are four new male characters, each with distinct personalities and ties to the Doki girls we know and love. It tackles how Sayori might deal with her self-awareness, in light of her depression, and also asks what the club would be like if it were larger. I won't delve too much further into detail, I'll let that be left for later.",

They are comedy mods that use satire. A select few might not find them funny, but to be fair, you have to have a high IQ to understand DDCC and DDCC2.If you haven't yet, you should play the original first since it will help you understand the story. Liked the first one? Then you're going to love this one. The positive feedback the first one got inspired me to create this sequel. It's a more ambitious mod and I've spent a lot more time making this than the original. (If I had to estimate, I probably spent around 200 hours on it.)A quick rundown of what the mod has in store: less college aspect, focuses on solving problems in the original, routes for each of the original Dokis, a route for a new new Doki: Amy, retains subtle and not so subtle memes. Overall, more content than the original",

Only then will it start. This has been made with all our love and care for the game, and as a thanks for the experience it has given to me. As a side note, I'm not natively English, so there might be some errors here and there. I'm accepting any kind of feedback, whether it's good or bad, because I want to improve myself, for the sake of this and for the sake of my future releases, if any. You'll know the installation of the mod worked if the game's title has three exclamation marks, and the version number in the Settings window has (mo) added to it. This was made for the standalone PC version, so expect the exclusive steam stuff to not happen. With love and care, NNDanny. Editor's notes: The current version of this mod contains a few bugs that can be ignored by clicking the \"Ignore\" button. Additionally, you can turn on \"Skip unseen text\" on the Settings screen to skip over dialogue while collecting the artworks necessary for the good ending. Lastly, the length of the mod was determined based on a playthrough where the standard DDLC content is skipped.",

The demo follows from the prologue to the first boss battle, with new words for the poem minigame (some of them Sonic related, discover them!), Monika added to the poem minigame and with exclusive scenes, custom sprites (some made by me, some renders of Sonic games), Sonic levels backgrounds, title cards for the ambience, and Sonic Mania/Forces music and sounds added. But watch out! One of the girls will follow an evil route and change radically the story, the menu logos, the poem minigame background and some parts of the dialog. If you choose her and listen to the low pitch Ring sound at the start of her exclusive scenes, you will help her in her Empire dream! (cof cof just Yuri cof cof!) And also, there is a content warning in one of the second exclusive scenes, but there are buttons to choose if you want to skip it, or be brave and see it.",

With a main focus on gaslighting, character assassination, forgettable world-building, and testing your patience, you won’t find another mod quite like this. If you’re after a mod that gives love and care to its characters (both literally and metaphorically), then go play The Good Ending. This is an 8-9 hour experience, best suited for readers wanting to suffer as they watch their favorite Dokis grow into manipulated versions of themselves, all while shadowboxing against impossible and non-existent challenges, and plenty of sweet filler to truly cultivate into something insufferable.",

Hanako is red-headed, and she is the villain. Long story short, Monika traps Hanako in a classroom, and June releases her. But Hanako’s true intention is to kill all Monikas' in existence (ie. other people's mods). And to do so, she needs the Infinity Pens. So, it's up to June to stop her and find the pens before she does. But it looks like Monika is hiding something, too. - CaptainOreo [NOTE: This modification is an unofficial edit from an outside party as the original was not in accordance with Team Salvato IP Guidelines previously, and this version will not be fixed by CaptainOreo.]",

His more mysterious, reserved nature usually results in him taking a backseat (or just staying out of) most social environments, seeing no use in getting involved in any types of extracurricular activities. On the other end of the spectrum, there's the normal MC who's already established in the club and preparing for said 'festival'. He's the one we all know and love, so I'm sure you'll know him already. That said, the lives of our main protagonists are soon to change in ways they couldn't have ever expected, both good and bad.",

      "description": "Come to shore with this extraordinary fan-made sequel to the critically acclaimed Doki Doki Literature Club! Get to know the lives of your favorite Dokis, both in and out of school, and meet new people along the way. Doki Doki Undercurrents, or DDU for short, is a sequel following the events of the original Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC).\n\nIt takes what DDLC has done and builds on its foundations, adding more to the lore and the grim psychological horror. One of the main themes of DDLC was the surreal nature of the unexpected, usually in the form of jumpscares - This mod, however, looks into what truly makes a tale unnerving.\n\nThrough the eyes of Melody, you'll explore the expanded world of Doki Doki Undercurrents, learning about a multitude of characters and their lives, both in and out of school. You'll watch her grow and learn, and be the hand to guide her when things are at their most unforgiving. This is a story centred around the many challenges life brings, the desire to rise to the occasion, and the consequences that come with hubris.\n\nWill you be the one to master the waves, or will you, too, be swept into the undercurrents?",
