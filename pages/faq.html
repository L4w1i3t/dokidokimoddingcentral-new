                        <p>TL;DR Doki Doki Modding Central (DDMC) is a comprehensive sister platform dedicated to creating, sharing, and 
                            exploring modifications for <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em> by Team Salvato. It serves as a hub 
                            for modders and fans to collaborate, share resources, and enhance their experience.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We have two specific Google Forms that you can access by going to their respective pages. You can submit your
                            mod by filling out the mod submission form with all the requisite information. The other form is where you
                            can submit assets (music, code, sprites, art, etc.) to be uploaded for others to use.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, although we try to be as hands-off as we can; we're not an anarchy, but we also don't rule with an iron fist 
                            either. See the "About" page for what we do enforce.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>While the specific tools depend on the type of mod you're creating, most DDLC mods are developed using 
                            the Ren'Py engine. We provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials in the classroom to help you 
                            get started, if you need help, or if you want to learn anything new.</p>

                        <p>Getting involved in the community can be as simple as contributing your thoughts and ideas--it makes a big 
                            difference and supports everyone here. If you'd like to take a more active role, you can connect with staff 
                            and other members through our subreddit or Discord server. For those interested in joining the team, we 
                            announce open positions whenever we're hiring. If you're passionate and interested, let us know! We value 
                            merit and commitment above all else.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely! Not only do we have a dedicated feedback form and channel in the Discord server, where you can either
                            be anonymous or known. You can also reach out to one of the staff members directly if you so choose. Also note that
                            feedback is not just exclusive to technical issues; your complaints can also be about anything that may impact the
                            community negatively if left unchecked--harrassment by other users, abuse of power by a staff member, grooming,
                            you name it. We value all input regardless of significance.

                            Keep in mind: we actually don't ban people from the Discord server, only with particularly egregious exceptions;
                            see the server to find out what we do instead. As for uploading mods as a banned user, you absolutely can, as per rule
                            1 on the "About" page. We like to separate art from artist here.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>
                            Yes, you can submit your mods regardless of engine or how you made it. Be advised that during your submission, you
                            will have to outline how exactly to install and run it, as it would deviate from the standard instructions.
                            Also remember that your mod <strong>does</strong> have to be complicit with Team Salvato's IP Guidelines, so
                            you can't submit a pre-installed/pre-built mod. We don't make the rules, we just enforce them.

                            Please have patience. We have at most two people right now that manage the site--one is a busy IT specialist, and
                            the other is a busy university student. Point is, we do have lives, and we will upload mods and assets whenever
                            we have the chance to. As such, we also prefer to upload in massive batches instead of on an individual basis,
                            so be assured that you're not the only one thinking this. TL;DR we'll get to your stuff eventually.
