                  Doki Doki Modding Central (DDMC) is a comprehensive platform
                  dedicated to creating, sharing, and exploring modifications
                  for <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em> by Team Salvato. It
                  serves as a hub for modders and fans to collaborate, share

                <p>
                  DDMC was created in October 2023 to provide an inclusive,
                  drama-free environment for the DDLC modding community. Our
                  goal is to foster creativity, archive and preserve mods, and
                  provide resources for modders without the politics and
                  restrictions that have affected other communities. Our motto
                  is "Archive Everything" - we believe in preserving the
                  community's creative work regardless of internet drama or
                  stigma.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  While the specific tools depend on the type of mod you're
                  creating, most DDLC mods are developed using the Ren'Py
                  engine. We provide comprehensive documentation and tutorials
                  in the classroom to help you get started, if you need help, or
                  if you want to learn anything new. Common tools include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ren'Py SDK (Software Development Kit)</li>
                  <li>A text editor (VSCode, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Image editing software (for backgrounds and sprites)</li>
                  <li>
                    Audio editing software (optional, for custom music/sounds)
                  </li>

                My mod wasn't made with Ren'Py. Can it still be added to the

              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  Yes, you can submit your mods regardless of engine or how you
                  made it. Be advised that during your submission, you will have
                  to outline how exactly to install and run it, as it would
                  deviate from the standard instructions. Also remember that
                  your mod <strong>does</strong> have to be complicit with Team
                  Salvato's IP Guidelines, so you can't submit a
                  pre-installed/pre-built mod. We don't make the rules, we just
                  enforce them.

                <p>
                  Yes, although we try to be as hands-off as we can; we're not
                  an anarchy, but we also don't rule with an iron fist either.
                  See the "About" page for what we do enforce. The most
                  important rules to follow are:

                  Please have patience. We have at most two people right now
                  that manage the site--one is a busy IT specialist, and the
                  other is a busy university student. Point is, we do have
                  lives, and we will upload mods and assets whenever we have the
                  chance to. As such, we also prefer to upload in massive
                  batches instead of on an individual basis, so be assured that
                  you're not the only one thinking this. TL;DR we'll get to your
                  stuff eventually.

                  Yes, you can submit updates to your mod or assets using the

                  <li>This is an update to an existing submission</li>

                  DDMC was founded on these key principles that set us apart:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Archive Everything</strong> - We believe in
                    preserving the community's creative work
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Minimal Censorship</strong> - We support creative
                    freedom within legal boundaries
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Community-First</strong> - Decisions are made with
                    the community's interests in mind
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Drama-Free</strong> - We focus on creativity and
                    collaboration, not politics
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Transparency</strong> - Open communication and
                    accountability from staff
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  These principles guide everything we do and have created a
                  more relaxed, creative-focused community.
