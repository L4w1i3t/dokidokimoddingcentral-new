                    Doki Doki Modding Central is an all-encompassing fan modification emporium for modifying <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em> by Team Salvato. Made by a handful of individuals with years of experience in the DDLC modding scene, this website is made in hopes to provide a space for the consumption, exploration, critique, and creation of modifications for the franchise. This initiative is cultivated by providing a repository of mods, new and republished, regardless of petty internet drama or stigma. Alongside this, we wish to provide the resources necessary to generate new content for the franchise and give a foot in the door for new entrants into game creation. The implementation of a Discord server for discussion of modifications hopes to achieve a ground of active communication and attributing to the betterment of mod creation and story-telling, meanwhile giving a place for fans to discuss amongst themselves and provide crucial feedback on works that the authors can partake in.

                <p>
                    This website was born out of a kindling of hope in October of 2023 by Savage Sentral, Tune Eternal, and JayQilin. Formerly members of the subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCmods" target="_blank"><strong>r/DDLCmods</strong></a>, better known as the Doki Doki Modding Community, these three deliberated the idea of creating a website independent from the subreddit to restore a sense of self to the original idea of modding Doki Doki Literature Club: to foster fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the course of three years between 2021 and 2023, these three quickly gained notoriety in the grander modding community and main DDLC community by extension. What for, you may be asking? The reason is simple: for calling out the lack of care for the community members. Savage Sentral, lead creator of the website, is a content creator best known for the documentation and journalistic reporting of ongoing dramas in the community. Whether it is exposing creeps and pedophiles, reporting on bizarre happenings, and generally informing the public to what is occurring in the modding scene, Savage Sentral stands as a vanguard for the safety of the modding community. Savage Sentral would initially get in contact with Tune Eternal, JayQilin, and site developer/admin/owner, L4w1i3t, in October of 2022 at the peak of the former existence of Team Red Mazda RX-7 (STOCK), which would kindle a close friendship eventually leading to where we are today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was through the destruction of Team Red Mazda RX-7 (STOCK) that solidified our virtues. During this time and in the year after, it was seen that there was deeply-seated corruption at every step in the Doki Doki Modding Community. Not only this, but an observable lack of care, understanding, and intelligence, too. Under the guise of justice and a fair application of the law, the moderators of the subreddit threw out their only investigator into the drama, L4w1i3t. When reaching out over concerns relating to mental health and wellbeing, the administrators showed pure hostility in asking for their aid. And when asked for a whole week while the drama transpired to take action against the troublemakers perpetuating it, they instead did everything in their power to smite the victims. It was through this drama that repercussions are still felt to this day in the modding community as a whole. Quarantine of the subreddit requires the pre-approval of posts, suspicion of alternative accounts at every turn, and deletion of content or posts for anything that might show any slight deviation from whatever approved narrative the administration has. All of that is due to what happened in October 2022.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout 2023, the site founders partook in thorough investigation spanning the entirety of the life of the modding community to determine the failings of that drama. The suspected originators of the drama, which the administrators were made aware of at the time, revealed themselves months later as being the ones to start it, having the inaction of the admins being the cause of a whole mod team being disintegrated. The administrators having a heavy hand in censorship, while having a past uncleansed revealing lack of sympathy for the mentally distressed and suicidal. Favoritism too being the cause of inaction, as key members of a well-known mod team being the sole culprits, one of which being a pedophile, had sketchy opinions in favor of them shown by existing moderators. Founder of DokiMods.me, ItsZekrom, using alternative accounts to run defense for said pedophile. And despite all of this, every founder of this site was banned for voicing concern and attempting to help, alongside everyone in association with them found in their midst.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And it wasn't just here that this downfall originated, in the past, there were many years worth of trouble in the modding scene. From splinter cells of former moderators attempting to co-opt the main community with another subreddit, to their founder being accused of pedophilia, to high-profile mod creators having unfair treatment applied to them by overbearing enforcement, and so much more. There is not a single moment in the rich history of the modding community that isn't rife with drama, and the people leading the charge against it show that they only get worse and worse at handling it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this in mind, with what we here at DDMC have experienced firsthand, we have come to a set of rules of which we hold true. A framework of understanding that anyone visiting this site should be able to see weaved into every fiber of its being, as careful thought and care was put into every moment of it.

                <div class="about-answer">
                <p>Let's lay out the ground rules:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Archive EVERYTHING:</strong>
                        Unlike its contemporary, DDMC wishes to offer a platform in which everyone can express themselves and put their hard work out there: past, present, and future. With this, no stone goes unturned. This is a library of all mods and wishes that everyone gets their time to shine, no matter what someone has to say about them. With this too, no one should have to suffer FOMO from the removal of a mod, so mods removed due to controversy should also be posted here. Like stated before, archive EVERYTHING.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>1a.</strong> All mod creations are accepted and will be published. This includes mods including copyrighted materials. It should be your responsibility to uphold the copyright law of your respective country, understand the copyright policies of external content sites like YouTube, as well as follow the <a href="http://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines/" target="_blank"><strong>Team Salvato IP Guidelines</strong></a>. We will not enforce action against the individuals violating any of these and are not responsible by proxy for any infringements. It is up to the original holders of respective IPs to reach out to the individuals that used the materials wrongly on a discretionary basis. So if any of this is confusing to a fellow mod creator, simply put, negligence of the law does not make you exempt from it. Make everyone's life easier by taking the proper precautions before publishing new creations.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Don't Publish Anything Illegal or Maliciously Offensive (To Your Respective Jurisdiction):</strong>
                        Does this really need explaining?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Have Fun:</strong>
                        This is a portal for the expansion of a video game after all. The main focus should always be for your enjoyment. If you wish to post here, know that you are contributing to the greater enjoyment of others and that everyone that comes across your projects and contributions will be grateful for them.

                                    had the community's wellbeing in the forefront of my mind and was kicked out for it. I stand for
