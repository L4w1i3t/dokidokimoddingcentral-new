              Doki Doki Modding Central is an all-encompassing fan modification
              emporium for modifying <em>Doki Doki Literature Club!</em> by Team
              Salvato. Made by a handful of individuals with years of experience
              in the DDLC modding scene, this website is made in hopes to
              provide a space for the consumption, exploration, critique, and
              creation of modifications for the franchise. This initiative is
              cultivated by providing a repository of mods, new and republished,
              regardless of petty internet drama or stigma. Alongside this, we
              wish to provide the resources necessary to generate new content
              for the franchise and give a foot in the door for new entrants
              into game creation. The implementation of a Discord server for
              discussion of modifications hopes to achieve a ground of active
              communication and attributing to the betterment of mod creation
              and story-telling, meanwhile giving a place for fans to discuss
              amongst themselves and provide crucial feedback on works that the
              authors can partake in.

              This website was born out of a kindling of hope in October of 2023
              by Savage Sentral, Tune Eternal, and JayQilin. Formerly members of
              the subreddit,
              <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLCmods" target="_blank"
                ><strong>r/DDLCmods</strong></a
              >, better known as the Doki Doki Modding Community, these three
              deliberated the idea of creating a website independent from the
              subreddit to restore a sense of self to the original idea of
              modding Doki Doki Literature Club: to foster fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the course of three years between 2021 and 2023, these three
              quickly gained notoriety in the grander modding community and main
              DDLC community by extension. What for, you may be asking? The
              reason is simple: for calling out the lack of care for the
              community members. Savage Sentral, lead creator of the website, is
              a content creator best known for the documentation and
              journalistic reporting of ongoing dramas in the community. Whether
              it is exposing creeps and pedophiles, reporting on bizarre
              happenings, and generally informing the public to what is
              occurring in the modding scene, Savage Sentral stands as a
              vanguard for the safety of the modding community. Savage Sentral
              would initially get in contact with Tune Eternal, JayQilin, and
              site developer/admin/owner, L4w1i3t, in October of 2022 at the
              peak of the former existence of Team Red Mazda RX-7 (STOCK), which
              would kindle a close friendship eventually leading to where we are
              today.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was through the destruction of Team Red Mazda RX-7 (STOCK) that
              solidified our virtues. During this time and in the year after, it
              was seen that there was deeply-seated corruption at every step in
              the Doki Doki Modding Community. Not only this, but an observable
              lack of care, understanding, and intelligence, too. Under the
              guise of justice and a fair application of the law, the moderators
              of the subreddit threw out their only investigator into the drama,
              L4w1i3t. When reaching out over concerns relating to mental health
              and wellbeing, the administrators showed pure hostility in asking
              for their aid. And when asked for a whole week while the drama
              transpired to take action against the troublemakers perpetuating
              it, they instead did everything in their power to smite the
              victims. It was through this drama that repercussions are still
              felt to this day in the modding community as a whole. Quarantine
              of the subreddit requires the pre-approval of posts, suspicion of
              alternative accounts at every turn, and deletion of content or
              posts for anything that might show any slight deviation from
              whatever approved narrative the administration has. All of that is
              due to what happened in October 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout 2023, the site founders partook in thorough
              investigation spanning the entirety of the life of the modding
              community to determine the failings of that drama. The suspected
              originators of the drama, which the administrators were made aware
              of at the time, revealed themselves months later as being the ones
              to start it, having the inaction of the admins being the cause of
              a whole mod team being disintegrated. The administrators having a
              heavy hand in censorship, while having a past uncleansed revealing
              lack of sympathy for the mentally distressed and suicidal.
              Favoritism too being the cause of inaction, as key members of a
              well-known mod team being the sole culprits, one of which being a
              pedophile, had sketchy opinions in favor of them shown by existing
              moderators. Founder of DokiMods.me, ItsZekrom, using alternative
              accounts to run defense for said pedophile. And despite all of
              this, every founder of this site was banned for voicing concern
              and attempting to help, alongside everyone in association with
              them found in their midst.
            </p>
            <p>
              And it wasn't just here that this downfall originated, in the
              past, there were many years worth of trouble in the modding scene.
              From splinter cells of former moderators attempting to co-opt the
              main community with another subreddit, to their founder being
              accused of pedophilia, to high-profile mod creators having unfair
              treatment applied to them by overbearing enforcement, and so much
              more. There is not a single moment in the rich history of the
              modding community that isn't rife with drama, and the people
              leading the charge against it show that they only get worse and
              worse at handling it.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this in mind, with what we here at DDMC have experienced
              firsthand, we have come to a set of rules of which we hold true. A
              framework of understanding that anyone visiting this site should
              be able to see weaved into every fiber of its being, as careful
              thought and care was put into every moment of it.

                    What it is, what it do! My name is JayQilin or JQilin on
                    Youtube. I've been a DDLC fan since 2017 and a DDLC content
                    creator since 2020. I'm a fan of people expressing
                    themselves in new, creative ways and I welcome everyone who
                    wants to put their best foot forward to make incredible
                    content! TL:DR, I'm just a guy who's a Dokituber for fun. I
                    didn't choose the Doki life, the Doki life chose me.

                    Musician foremost and multimedia artist second. I landed in
                    the DDLC community with commission work for Tropical Rain by
                    PumpkinbrainUS, eventually making ranks with former Team Red
                    Mazda RX-7, making and working on projects such as EGO
                    DEATH, Left Behind, Presents and Poems, SVHS-TAP, Spilt
                    Spaghetti, Sigma Club 2, Triple Trouble, and much more. I
                    have always had the community's wellbeing in the forefront
                    of my mind and was kicked out for it. I stand for the equal
                    and moderate treatment of creators and the gifts they wish
                    to present to the world.

                    Greetings! My name is Finn the Diamond Knight, but you can
                    call me Finn or Finn TDK for short. Been a DDLC fan since
                    2018 and a DokiTuber/content creator since 2021 as my
                    newfound appreciation of the series. Poetry, stories,
                    history, you name it! It's like an empty page for your
                    imagination to take over and run wild, or a new adventure! I
                    stand by to those whom I'm loyal with to help out in any way
                    I can for a good cause on equal ground. Most importantly,
                    stay awesome and have fun!
